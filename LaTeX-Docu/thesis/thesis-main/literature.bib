    abstract = {Urban arterial traffic coordination control catches great attention in the process of smart city construction. To achieve the optimum signal timing, many studies attempt to adjust green splits of a cycle time according to the distance between the road intersections. However, the existing green wave traffic control system usually has a sophisticated calculation, which depends upon the stability of vehicle speed and traffic flow, leading to weak robustness. Therefore, this short paper puts forward ES-Band, that is, a novel approach to control arterial traffic coordination with the help of artificial intelligence. ES-Band introduces the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies (CMA-ES), a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning, into signal timing. Different traffic variables are adopted as parameters for searching the optimal value by CMA-ES. In order to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of ES-Band, we import the real traffic flow data of Zhongshan Road in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China, into traffic environment simulator for training and carry out a series of experiments. The results have shown that the ES-Band outperforms the traditional methods in terms of a better convergence, lower travel time, and fewer stops.},

    abstract = {Bicycle traffic operations become increasingly important and yet are largely ignored in the traffic flow community, until recently. We hypothesize that there is no qualitative difference between vehicular and bicycle traffic flow dynamics in single-file case, so the latter can be described by reparameterized car-following models. To test this proposition, we reproduce German (Andresen et al., 2014) and Chinese (Jiang et al., 2016) bicycle experiments on a ring with the intelligent-driver model (IDM) and compare its fit quality (calibration) and predictive power (validation) with that of the necessary-deceleration-model (NDM), which is specifically designed for bike traffic. We find similar quality metrics for both models, so the above hypothesis of a qualitative equivalence cannot be rejected. Moreover, calibration errors of the IDM turn up to be slightly smaller compared to the NDM ones. The NDM represents significant calibration errors for high flow densities, which correspond to flow states, when stop-and-go wave emerge. According to validation tests, the IDM outperforms the NDM as well. Performing two types of validation techniques we discover that inter-driver variation is much higher than the intra-driver variation for bicycle traffic. It coincides with the results obtained from vehicular traffic experiments (NGSIM trajectory data). In addition, we suggest the measure for quantitative comparison of two microscopic fundamental diagrams, which are derived from experimental data and simulated trajectories. The analysis of speed-density relations provides more or less the same results for both models.},

While there are some models of non-specific SoS, few attempts have been made to demonstrate these models with simulation. Simulations of SoS are usually specific cases. Likewise, in the description of a SoS, most of the approaches have focused on their characterization, yet this characterization has not been greatly utilized as an underlying feature in the modeling and simulation of SoS. We review different modeling techniques and use two converse techniques, i.e. agent-based and event-based modeling, to run a simulation of hypothetical systems collaborating into a SoS. The results of the empirical comparison indicate an agent-based modeling approach would achieve a characterization model better with validation achieved through an event-based approach.},

    abstract = {An intelligent combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) and approaches to modeling and simulation is one of the most challenging endeavors for future cities, manufacturing industries, and predictive maintenance. Digital Twins take on a unique role here. However, the question of what a Digital Twin is and what differentiates it from a regular model is still open. We present an experimental setup for integrating an existing simulation model of Hamburg's traffic system with the city's real-time sensor network. The Digital Twin is implemented using the large-scale multi-agent framework MARS. The entire process from the model description to retrieving real-time data from the IoT sensors and incorporating it in the simulation is presented. As a first prototypical example, a multi-modal mobility model was connected to real-world bike-sharing locations in Hamburg. We find that the combination of multi-agent systems and IoT sensors as a Digital Twin shows enormous potential for city planners, policy stakeholders, and other decision-makers. By correcting the course of a simulation via real-time data, the corridor-of-uncertainty that is intrinsic to some simulation models' use can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, any divergence of simulated and sampled data can lead to a deeper understanding of complex adaptive systems like big cities.},

    abstract = {The current trend towards living in big cities contributes to an increased demand for efficient and sustainable space and resource allocation in urban environments. This leads to enormous pressure for resource minimization in city planning. One pillar of efficient city management is a smart intermodal traffic system. Planning and organizing the various kinds of modes of transport in a complex and dynamically adaptive system such as a city is inherently challenging. By deliberately simplifying reality, models can help decision-makers shape the traffic systems of tomorrow. Meanwhile, Smart City initiatives are investing in sensors to observe and manage many kinds of urban resources, making up a part of the Internet of Things (IoT) that produces massive amounts of data relevant for urban planning and monitoring. We use these new data sources of smart cities by integrating real-time data of IoT sensors in an ongoing simulation. In this sense, the model is a digital twin of its real-world counterpart, being augmented with real-world data. To our knowledge, this is a novel instance of real-time correction during simulation of an agent-based model. The process of creating a valid mapping between model components and real-world objects posed several challenges and offered valuable insights, particularly when studying the interaction between humans and their environment. As a proof-of-concept for our implementation, we designed a showcase with bike rental stations in Hamburg-Harburg, a southern district of Hamburg, Germany. Our objective was to investigate the concept of real-time data correction in agent-based modeling, which we consider to hold great potential for improving the predictive capabilities of models. In particular, we hope that the chosen proof-of-concept informs the ongoing politically supported trends in mobility—away from individual and private transport and towards—in Hamburg.},

    abstract = {Models can provide valuable decision support in the ongoing effort to create a sustainable and effective modality mix in urban settings. Modern transportation infrastructures must meaningfully combine public transport with other mobility initiatives such as shared and on-demand systems. The increase of options and possibilities in multi-modal travel implies an increase in complexity when planning and implementing such an infrastructure. Multi-agent systems are well-suited for addressing questions that require an understanding of movement patterns and decision processes at the individual level. Such models should feature intelligent software agents with flexible internal logic and accurately represent the core functionalities of new modalities. We present a model in which agents can choose between owned modalities, station-based bike sharing modalities, and free-floating car sharing modalities as they exit the public transportation system and seek to finish their personal multi-modal trip. Agents move on a multi-modal road network where dynamic constraints in route planning are evaluated based on an agent’s query. Modality switch points (MSPs) along the route indicate the locations at which an agent can switch from one modality to the next (e.g., a bike rental station to return a used rental bike and continue on foot). The technical implementation of MSPs within the road network was a central focus in this work. To test their efficacy in a controlled experimental setting, agents optimized only the travel time of their multi-modal routes. However, the functionalities of the model enable the implementation of different optimization criteria (e.g., financial considerations or climate neutrality) and unique agent preferences as well. Our findings show that the implemented MSPs enable agents to switch between modalities at any time, allowing for the kind of versatile, individual, and spontaneous travel that is common in modern multi-modal settings.},
