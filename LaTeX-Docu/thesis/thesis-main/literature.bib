Finally, a reinforcement learning approach (Q-LEARNING) is presented to learn the traffic light controller how to interact with drivers with different situation. By keeping a belief the level of cooperation drivers, we improved the performance of Q-LEARNING algorithms. We show that our traffic light controller successfully learns how to manage the intersection with less deadlocks than without learning.},

    abstract = {Urban arterial traffic coordination control catches great attention in the process of smart city construction. To achieve the optimum signal timing, many studies attempt to adjust green splits of a cycle time according to the distance between the road intersections. However, the existing green wave traffic control system usually has a sophisticated calculation, which depends upon the stability of vehicle speed and traffic flow, leading to weak robustness. Therefore, this short paper puts forward ES-Band, that is, a novel approach to control arterial traffic coordination with the help of artificial intelligence. ES-Band introduces the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies (CMA-ES), a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning, into signal timing. Different traffic variables are adopted as parameters for searching the optimal value by CMA-ES. In order to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of ES-Band, we import the real traffic flow data of Zhongshan Road in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China, into traffic environment simulator for training and carry out a series of experiments. The results have shown that the ES-Band outperforms the traditional methods in terms of a better convergence, lower travel time, and fewer stops.},

@article{Kurtc2020,
    abstract = {Bicycle traffic operations become increasingly important and yet are largely ignored in the traffic flow community, until recently. We hypothesize that there is no qualitative difference between vehicular and bicycle traffic flow dynamics in single-file case, so the latter can be described by reparameterized car-following models. To test this proposition, we reproduce German (Andresen et al., 2014) and Chinese (Jiang et al., 2016) bicycle experiments on a ring with the intelligent-driver model (IDM) and compare its fit quality (calibration) and predictive power (validation) with that of the necessary-deceleration-model (NDM), which is specifically designed for bike traffic. We find similar quality metrics for both models, so the above hypothesis of a qualitative equivalence cannot be rejected. Moreover, calibration errors of the IDM turn up to be slightly smaller compared to the NDM ones. The NDM represents significant calibration errors for high flow densities, which correspond to flow states, when stop-and-go wave emerge. According to validation tests, the IDM outperforms the NDM as well. Performing two types of validation techniques we discover that inter-driver variation is much higher than the intra-driver variation for bicycle traffic. It coincides with the results obtained from vehicular traffic experiments (NGSIM trajectory data). In addition, we suggest the measure for quantitative comparison of two microscopic fundamental diagrams, which are derived from experimental data and simulated trajectories. The analysis of speed-density relations provides more or less the same results for both models.},

@article{Kuang2021,
    abstract = {Efficient signal control at isolated intersections is vital for relieving congestion, accidents, and environmental pollution caused by increasing numbers of vehicles. However, most of the existing studies not only ignore the constraint of the limited computing resources available at isolated intersections but also the matching degree between the signal timing and the traffic demand, leading to high complexity and reduced learning efficiency. In this article, we propose a traffic signal control method based on reinforcement learning with state reduction. First, a reinforcement learning model is established based on historical traffic flow data, and we propose a dual-objective reward function that can reduce vehicle delay and improve the matching degree between signal time allocation and traffic demand, allowing the agent to learn the optimal signal timing strategy quickly. Second, the state and action spaces of the model are preliminarily reduced by selecting a proper control phase combination; then, the state space is further reduced by eliminating rare or nonexistent states based on the historical traffic flow. Finally, a simplified Q-Table is generated and used to optimize the complexity of the control algorithm. The results of simulation experiments show that our proposed control algorithm effectively improves the capacity of isolated intersections while reducing the time and space costs of the signal control algorithm.},

    abstract = {In order to understand how we may engineer system of systems (SoS), we will have to rely significantly on our abilities in modeling and simulation. While there are some models of non-specific SoS, few attempts have been made to demonstrate these models with simulation. Simulations of SoS are usually specific cases. Likewise, in the description of a SoS, most of the approaches have focused on their characterization, yet this characterization has not been greatly utilized as an underlying feature in the modeling and simulation of SoS. We review different modeling techniques and use two converse techniques, i.e. agent-based and event-based modeling, to run a simulation of hypothetical systems collaborating into a SoS. The results of the empirical comparison indicate an agent-based modeling approach would achieve a characterization model better with validation achieved through an event-based approach.},

Since a reorienation of traffic involves considerable effort, traffic simulations are used for planning. In this thesis the SmartOpenHamburg project is extended by the possibility to simulate
cyclists. For this purpose, characteristics of cyclists and bicycles are researched and different behavioral models are considered. The implementation is based on a variant of the Wiedemann 99 model adapted for cyclists. After checking the general driving behaviour of the cyclist agents, the influence of cyclists on road traffic is examined on the basis of the implementation. It is shown that there is a mutual influence of cyclists and other road
